# OK, Game On!

OK, Game On! (working title) or “OKGO” is a Windows application offering eye control access to many games via keyboard, mouse and gamepad emulation. It is based on the excellent [Optikey](https://github.com/OptiKey/OptiKey/) and [EyeMine](https://github.com/SpecialEffect/EyeMine/) projects.

# Setup / install

OKGO uses the .Net 4.6 Framework and is designed to run on Windows 8 / 8.1 / 10 / 11. 

Before running OKGO, you must separately install the latest version of ViGemBus from https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases (run ViGEmBusSetup_x86.msi or ViGEmBusSetup_x64.msi depending if you have a 32-bit or 64-bit PC)

# Tips and tricks

- Ideally you should not have any other USB controllers connected to your PC - OKGO will create a virtual one that you can see in the “Game Controllers” list in Windows, and many games don’t like more than one controller attached

- Some games may be sensitive to launch order - e.g. they require OKGO to be running before the game is launched (or maybe vice versa). Feedback is very welcome if you take notes on this.

- Sometimes it may be necessary to set yout game to use “fullscreen windowed” or “windowed” + maximised, other games work fine in fullscreen mode.

- If the game isn’t responding to OKGO, make sure the game has focus by clicking on the game with a mouse.

# Included keyboards

OK Game On comes bundled with starter interfaces for a few different games as well as generic interfaces to try out the controls. If you’ve tried the controls and want to build a custom interface, get in touch: kirsty.mcnaught@gmail.com
