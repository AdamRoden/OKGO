# CraytaAccess

CraytaAccess provides an on-screen gaze-controlled keyboard to support eye-gaze access to [Crayta](https://crayta.com/). This allowed disabled creators to build games using only eye control. 

To find out more or to get involved with testing, contact kmcnaught@unit2games.com

# System requirements

CraytaAccess uses the .Net 4.6 Framework and is designed to run on Windows 8 / 8.1 / 10. It requires the [ViGem Bus Driver](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases) to be installed separately.

Crayta is available on Stadia, which is [available in these countries](https://support.google.com/stadia/answer/9338852) and has [minimum broadband connection requirements](https://support.google.com/stadia/answer/9607891).

# Access requirements

CraytaAccess currently supports any Tobii eye tracker that works with the Tobii Eye Tracking engine. This includes all gaming eye trackers such as the Tobii EyeX, 4C and ET5, as well as some Tobii Dynavox eye trackers, depending on your setup. Contact kmcnaught@unit2games.com if you are unsure. 

Crayta is designed to be approachable and easy to use at different levels of expertise. However, there are a number of controls required and as such you will need relatively accurate eye control. If you've played [EyeMine](https://github.com/SpecialEffect/EyeMine/wiki) with the advanced keyboards, you will have no problem with CraytaAccess. If you've played EyeMine with the intermediate keyboards, you should be able to use Crayta, but please do talk to us for advice. If you'd like to play collaboratively with someone with limited eye gaze experience we can advise you how best to do this. Our goal is to make collaborative game-creation available to as many people as possible, and we are prepared to support individuals in this process.
